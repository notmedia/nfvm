# TODO List:

[x] Add progress info on switching version

**v0.2**
- Ability to use id's for packs and files
- Add alias to version, file? Because sometimes filename too long
- Update files if work dir when add new file
- Option to remove files from folder when removing pack/file/version
- Checksum version comparing on change?
- Option to check that pack version applied correctly
- Add completion to cli commands
- Add additional options to get stream/buffer of file.
- Create packs/files from folder
- Update file version paths.  
  Idea: when user creates pack on first PC and move project to the second PC, paths to files may be incorrect. Add option to update this paths automatically.
- Add more info in list command.
- API + documentation
- Tests
